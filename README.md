# World Of Tea

This project was created to help beginner students practice some important concepts of Java and OOP.
There are three branches, each containing a different version

Please note: for organisational reasons there has been a change of plans and World Of Tea has never been tested by anyone else. It probably still contains (unwanted) bugs.
Feel free to leave me some feedback if you find it useful and how you think it can be improved.

The main reason for the three different versions is that i had different ideas about how to work with it.
I decided to not settle for one option but to offer different perspectives for students to choose from
according to what they want to focus on.

The 'flaws' in publicTeaWithFlaws are there on purpose and are meant to be found and fixed in order to run
the program successfully and prepare a cup of tea.


## How to practice

Choose a version, check out the respective branche, explore it and prepare yourself a cup of tea.
Whatever branch you choose, make yourself familiar with the classes, how they are related and how they work together.

1. **publicTea** (default) this is the branch that you will see as default.
  - Go to the **Kitchen** and make yourself a **cupOfTea** ðŸ«– â˜•
  - Everything here is public. Go through each class and experiment with how you can restrict access (and what you have to change to make it still work). There is a hint **hidden** in one of the classes.
  - **Drink** more **Tea** in the **Kitchen** to check if everything works
2. **publicTeaWithFlaws** - ew! Bugs in the **Tea!**
  - You have to find and eliminate the bugs, before you can make Tea. After that, you can proceed as described in publicTea
3. **restrictedAccessWithFlaws -** you already have some privacy here, but something doesn't quite work.
  - Check for bugs!

Bonus: so far we have one type of Tea. Create more classes in the **Blends** package for more choice. You also have to tell the teapot about it!

Feel free to enhance your world of tea with more classes, interfaces, functions and members.

Good luck and enjoy your tea!
